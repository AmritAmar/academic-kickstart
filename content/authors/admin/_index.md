I am a software engineer who enjoys challenges and problem-solving. I am excited to apply my expertise in AI, Data, and Software Engineering to have a positive impact on the world.

Previously, I was a software engineer at [Meta Reality Labs Research](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/) where I worked on the future of [Augmented Reality](https://tech.fb.com/ar-vr/2021/03/inside-facebook-reality-labs-the-next-era-of-human-computer-interaction/) and [Contextualized AI](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/teaching-ai-to-view-the-world-through-your-eyes/) by developing [Project Aria](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/projectaria/). I then spearheaded the data engineering team at [Inflexion Games](https://www.inflexion.io/) on a live-service survival multiplayer game called [Nightingale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raSjAJcftMs). I do part-time consulting on AI and Data projects with businesses who want to reach their potential.

I graduated from [Cornell University](https://c.tenor.com/bFLnqeAN_LoAAAAC/andy-bernard-the-office.gif) with a Bachelor's in 2019 and a Master's in 2020. I possess experience in AI, Data, Embedded Systems, Robotics, Augmented/Virtual Reality, Game Design, and Computer Graphics. 

I am also a top scholar achiever from [Botswana](https://pixabay.com/images/search/botswana/), a [pianist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3Lzx8hTbaGUHeR0KagT448zOcbd1PEo5), a scuba diver, an [avid competitive gamer](https://xkcd.com/606/), and a [dog person](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ah6fmNEtXFI&feature=emb_logo) (look at [Ekko](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLz7YHlpcVW/)). Feel free to [directly message](https://twitter.com/_SirHack3r) or [email](mailto:a.amritamar@gmail.com) me about anything!
