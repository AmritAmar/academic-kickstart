#Hi! I'm a senior at Cornell University majoring in computer science. My interests encompass topics from cloud computing to algorithms to functional programming and more. Outside of programming, I also enjoy learning Japanese.

#I am a first year PhD student in Computer Science at Cornell University. My research interests are in artificial intelligence, constraint reasoning, and computational sustainability, and I am currently being advised by Prof. Carla Gomes and Prof. Bart Selman. I graduated from Illinois Wesleyan University in December 2017 with a B.S. in Computer Science, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Mark Liffiton.
