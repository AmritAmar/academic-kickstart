  I worked with Professor Steve Marschner and Professor Bruce Walter on *Exploring photo-realistic material rendering in VR*. This was done as my Master of Engineering final project. 
  
  * I used Unity to implement the [ellipsoid shading model](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/Projects/metalappearance/) which is a more realistic model than the standard shading models present in graphics applications, particularly with anisotropic surfaces. 
  * The goal is to test this shading model in a real-time interactive VR environment and compare the look of various materials to their real-life counterparts.
