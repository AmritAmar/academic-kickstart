This was a tiny project to mimic something a project I did in college in a Robotics class. We used [inverse kinematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_kinematics) to derive the required matrices and then the forces needed to move a robotic arm. This is a much simpler implementation in 2D. Stuff like this can be used for procedural animations (applying IK to rigging bones) and a ton of other things to create very realistic motion.
