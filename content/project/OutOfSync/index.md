*You are a lab assistant who has accidentally shattered the fabric of reality and created numerous rifts between worlds. Time, gravity, and even color have been drained from the world. Now you must travel through these rifts, recover the scattered shards of
space, and restore them to the riftss in order to fix the damage to reality.*

OutOfSync is a action, strategy platformer that relies on quick decision making and mechanics. You must plan your route and be quick as you collect the shards, return back to repair the rifts, and move to the next level. However, as you are doing this, clones of you will take your exact path - collide with them and you lose the game. 

The game was produced by Team Tektite, consisting of:

- Amrit Amar *(Project Lead)*
- Alan Pascual *(Architecture Lead)*
- Luke Shin *(Programmer)*
- Brandon Zhang *(Programmer)*
- Cathy Liu *(UI/UX Artist)*
- Sarah Skrutskie *(Character Artist)*

Special thanks to Adam Pascual for an amazing soundtrack!

The game is made using LibGDX and Box2D. As project lead, I managed the team, worked on imagining the core gameplay mechanics, set up meetings and developed a workflow and plan. Deliverables were due every two weeks and I learned how to manage a team effectively. As a programmer, I implemented graphics and animations in Java, along with building and testing the game.
