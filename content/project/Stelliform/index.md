*A star has fallen from the sky and the race is on to go claim it. However, the monsters around the area will not make it easy. Players can choose to play as a warrior, rogue, or wizard to blast through enemies by choosing powerful spells or attacks and casting them as quickly as possible while dodging enemy blows to stay alive.*

Stelliform is a real-time action card game that relies on quick swiping mechanics, split-second decision making, and pre-game planning. The integration of a real-time strategy card game with a stimulating swipe mechanic makes Stelliform a distinct and unique mobile game. By combining strategic card-based elements and real-time action, we want players to step into the shoes of a spellcaster, defeating enemies by constructing a spell deck and planning and casting spells under time pressure.

The game was produced by Team Sicko Code, consisting of:

- Amrit Amar *(Project Lead)*
- Alan Pascual *(Architecture Lead)*
- Luke Shin *(Programmer)*
- Brandon Zhang *(Programmer)*
- Hanna Arfine *(UI/UX Artist)*
- Ally Yuan *(Character Artist)*
- Michael Yee *(Music)*

The game is made using CUGL (Cornell University Graphics Library), a game engine designed by [Professor Walker White] (https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~wmwhite/) in C++. As project lead, I managed the team, worked on imagining the core gameplay mechanics, set up meetings and developed a workflow and plan. Deliverables were due every two weeks and I learned how to manage a team effectively. As a programmer, I implemented graphics and animations in C++, along with Android Building and testing.
