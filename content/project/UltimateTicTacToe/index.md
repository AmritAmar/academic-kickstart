This is an old project I recently ported over to JS. The original code for the project was written in Visual Basic 6, the first language I learnt. I returned to this project while learning JS (specifically using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)). It's a 2 player game that adds an extra layer of thinking to the original game of tic tac toe.

I hope to continue this by adding AI players!
