*You've crashed on a mysterious world after getting caught in an explosion. You've lost the shards that allowed you to fly and explore the galaxy. Make your way through different environments to find the shards and escape from the planet!*

Viridian is an action webgame made that relies on precise mechanics to make your way through a magical forest. Use your mouse to shoot and gain momentun as you travel through 3 biomes. Beware of shooting plants, however, as the forest is connected to each other and plants will actively try to defend their fellow flora. 

The game, featured on the frontpage of Newgrounds, was produced by Team LVI Studios, consisting of:

- Amrit Amar *(Project Lead)*
- Alan Pascual *(Architecture Lead)*
- Justin Lue *(Programmer)*
- Brandon Zhang *(Programmer)*
- Yanying (Mary) Ji *(UI/UX Artist)*
- Urael Xu *(Character Artist)*

The game is made using Unity Game Engine. Throughout development, the team released several builds of the game and gathered data using A/B testing on statistics such as player deaths, time spent on levels, and other indicators that the team used to incrementally build a better game. As project lead, I managed the team, worked on imagining the core gameplay mechanics, set up meetings and developed a workflow and plan. Deliverables were due every two weeks and I learned how to manage a team effectively. As a programmer, I implemented the levels and graphics in C#.
